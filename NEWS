Since this plugin is made of several components, figuring out the changes _relevant to you_ amongst all the moving pieces can be a tricky process.
This document will focus on the release notes of vlc-unity itself, unless specified otherwise.

For LibVLC changes, head over to https://code.videolan.org/videolan/vlc/-/blob/master/NEWS and the git history.
For LibVLCSharp changes, see https://code.videolan.org/videolan/LibVLCSharp/-/blob/master/NEWS.
